title: Cast Aluminum Covers and Pans
description: Differential covers, transmission pans, and engine oil pans act as a means of protection and an avenue of heat dissipation for their respective assemblies and the oil enclosed. I have designed over two dozen A356-T6 cast aluminum covers and pans, of which utilize mold techniques such as gravity and pressure die casting. In designing these parts, an in depth understanding of suspension component travel is required to ensure part compatibility without interference. One consistent design feature is a larger oil reservoir, which I have verified through extensive testing to lower peak temperatures during periodic high loads.

3D printing is used extensively to prototype and verify design clearances prior to approving designs and continuing to production runs of the component.

Heat exchange fins are located on the outside of the pan, parallel in direction with the air flow underneath the vehicle to maximize surface area and assist in heat dissipation from the transmission fluid to the outside environment.
