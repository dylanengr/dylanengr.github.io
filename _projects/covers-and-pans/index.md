title: Cast Aluminum Covers and Pans
description: Differential covers, transmission pans, and engine oil pans act as a means of protection and an avenue of heat dissipation for their respective assemblies and the oil enclosed. I have designed over two dozen A356-T6 cast aluminum covers and pans, of which utilize mold techniques such as gravity and pressure die casting. In designing these parts, an in depth understanding of suspension component travel is required to ensure part compatibility without interference. One consistent design feature is a larger oil reservoir, which I have verified through extensive testing to lower peak temperatures during periodic high loads.
