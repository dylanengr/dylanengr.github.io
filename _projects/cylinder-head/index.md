*Project is proprietary and details are limited.*

## Involvement
1. Reverse engineered classic cylinder head, capturing critical dimensions such as mounting surfaces, bolt locations, and inlet/outlet port surfaces.
2. Selected material based on strength and heat transfer characteristics.
3. Modeled new cylinderhead with machineable fin profiles.
4. Performed static simulations, generating stress mapping at max operating temperatures and combustion pressure.
5. Worked with motorsports industry professionals to run CFD simulations and optimize design.
