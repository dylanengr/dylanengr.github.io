## Design Requirements
- Must process 1’ sugarcane per min.
- Minimum 35% extraction of juice
- Must accommodate a maximum 2” diameter stalk
- Must be easily human powered
- Design will be no larger than 24”x24”x24”
- 33lb max weight per component
- Shall be safe to operate and not contaminate the juice
- Must withstand indoor and outdoor use
- Must be easily washable and maintained

## Approach
Many design solutions were considered and analyzed to solve the problem
established within the design requirements and parameters. The final
design solution selected was a compound-lever system due to its simplicity
and ability to multiply the manually input force effectively.

## Process
Once the general design solution was decided upon, many implementations were drawn, modeled, and simulated. Modeling and
static simulations were done within SOLIDWORKS. The ultimate design solution decided upon considered the materials available
within the budget specified, machinery available and manufacturing process required to produce the machine, the deadline to
complete manufacturing of a prototype with testing, among other factors.
