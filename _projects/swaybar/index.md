## Involvement
1. Scanned existing swaybar with ROMER arm.
2. Created skeleton within SOLIDWORKS, outlining bend paths.
3. Determined maximum diameter capable considering other vehicle components.
4. Utilized torsional shear stress equations to compare tube thickness to strength.
5. Selected thickness of swaybar tubing based on desired stiffness and weight metrics.
6. Completed model and verified fitment in vehicle.
